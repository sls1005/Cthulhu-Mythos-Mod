This is a mod for the Unciv game. It adds things from the Cthulhu Mythos, based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft. The things this adds are mostly beliefs and ruins. It also adds icons for some cults.

This is a non-profit project. It is unrelated with the author(s) of the stories.

Most of the icons are original works. They are unrelated with real-world entities.

### Warning

* Although none of the images supplied is really terrifying, some things from this mod can still cause discomfort and are thus not suitable for young children.

* This mod somehow makes the game more difficult, as it makes ruins dangerous.
